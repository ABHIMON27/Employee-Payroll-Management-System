# Employee Payroll Management System
ðŸ”· Overview
The Employee Payroll Management System is a Java-based console application designed to automate and simplify the payroll process within an organization. It enables the organization to maintain and calculate employee salary records based on predefined parameters such as Basic Salary, HRA (House Rent Allowance), and DA (Dearness Allowance).

This system helps reduce manual efforts, minimizes errors in salary calculations, and ensures transparent payroll processing.

Display Employee Records

Shows all employee data along with calculated salary components.

Simple Console Interface

Easy-to-use command-line interaction for quick operations.

ðŸ”· Technology Used
Programming Language: Java

Platform: Console-based

Data Handling: Java Collections (ArrayList)

ðŸ”· Working Principle
The system stores employee records in an ArrayList.

When a new employee is added, the system calculates the HRA, DA, and gross salary.

The data can be displayed at any time, showing salary breakdowns.

The calculations are handled using simple arithmetic logic:

HRA = 20% of Basic Salary

DA = 10% of Basic Salary

Gross Salary = Basic + HRA + DA
